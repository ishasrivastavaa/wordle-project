# Research Report

## Intro to React

### Summary of Work

I researched how to write in javascript and create a page in react. I also followed a tutorial on how to add a page specifically, I don't know if we will have time to sync the frontend and backend as well as add password hashing in.

### Motivation

I know to see how difficult it is to add a frontend page as well as write the logic in switching between pages.

### Time Spent

~30 minutes trying to get node.js to run, will include another troubleshooting report specifying difficulties.

~60 minutes following the tutorial

### Results

I started with reading about javascript and react[^1].

Then I read some reading on packages to switch between pages[^2]:

At last, I briefly followed a tutorial[^3][^4].
