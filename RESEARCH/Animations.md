## Adding Animations to Wordle Game

### Summary of Work  
I researched techniques for implementing animations in our Wordle game. My focus was on creating animations for scenarios when the user guesses the correct word or when they exhaust all their attempts 
without guessing the word. This involved exploring libraries like React Spring and Framer Motion, as well as studying CSS keyframe animations. I also reviewed best practices for integrating animations 
into React components to ensure smooth transitions and maintain performance.

### Motivation  
Animations improve user engagement and provide visual feedback for critical game events. For example, a celebratory animation when the correct word is guessed adds a rewarding experience, while a 
subtle animation for game-over scenarios ensures a polished user interface. Incorporating these elements aligns with our teamâ€™s goal of delivering an interactive and aesthetically appealing game.

### Time Spent  
- **~45 minutes** reviewing documentation for React Spring and Framer Motion. 
- **~45 minutes** experimenting with different animation styles using CSS keyframes and JavaScript-based animation triggers in React.

### Results  
I started working on the implementation of animations for the two scenarios.
