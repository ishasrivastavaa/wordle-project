Wordle: Each time the user accesses the application, they should be asked to guess a randomly selected 5-letter word from the database. The user is allowed up to 6 guesses, receiving basic feedback on whether their guess is correct, incorrect, or invalid. To validate the guesses, the program should compare the user's input with the list of valid words stored in the database. After 6 attempts, the correct word should be revealed. A simple input field and text output are sufficient for this functionality, with no need for an elaborate GUI.
